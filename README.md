# Block-Tetrics Game Using Java Swing
Welcome to Block-Tetrics! This is a classic arcade game where your goal is to stack falling Tetrominoes (geometric shapes made up of four squares) in order to create complete rows. Once a row is complete, it will be cleared, and you'll be earning points as more shape as u can fall into the ground. The game ends if the Tetrominoes stack up to the top of the playfield.

This version of Tetris includes the following features:
*Rotate Shape: You can rotate the falling Tetrominoes clockwise to fit them into the available gaps. Use the rotation controls to strategically position the Tetrominoes.
*Move Shape: You can move the falling Tetrominoes left or right to control their horizontal position. This allows you to create optimal arrangements and prevent gaps in the stack.
*Pause: If you need a break or want to strategize your moves, you can pause the game. The pause feature allows you to temporarily halt the falling Tetrominoes and resume the game when you're ready.
*Restart: If you want to start over, you can restart the game at any time. This will reset the playfield and your score.
